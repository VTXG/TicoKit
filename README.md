Started on July 28th 2025, it was made as a bundle of silly little patches I wrote, but quickly expanded into its current state.<br/>
Later on in development, Evanbowl decided to join in, doing some layout development and some minor features.<br/>

After four rewrites and one sentient crash that was caused by one typo, *here we are*.<br/>
